# Pokémon Soul Link Tracker

A web-based Pokemon soul link tracker! Supports generations 1-7.

Playing a Soul Link Nuzlocke with a friend? Trying to work out how on earth you'll keep track of the routes, Pokémon, if they've fainted, what gym you're up to, and what the optimal team is?

You're in the right place!

## What it does

- **Tracks soul links automatically** - pairs your Pokemon and enforces all the rules
- **Prevents cheating** - won't let you catch duplicate types or evolution families  
- **Gym progress tracking** - knows every gym leader and shows your current level cap
- **Team suggestions** - suggests optimal combinations from your caught Pokemon
- **Generation validation** - only shows Pokemon that exist in your chosen game
- **Streamer mode** - clean overlay window for streaming your run
- **Import/export** - save your progress as a file to backup or share

## How it works

Pick your generation, add Pokemon as you catch them, and it handles the rest. Drag Pokemon to your team and it'll warn you about rule violations. When a Pokemon faints, its soul link partner gets removed automatically.

Works with every major Pokemon game from Red/Blue through Sun/Moon, with all the routes and gym leaders you'd expect.

This is in development and being worked on in my free time. There is no server, your teams are saved to browser, but you can export for safe keeping or to transfer between PCs!
