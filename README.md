# SoulLink
A web-based Pok√©mon soul link tracker! Supports generations 1-7.

Playing a Soul Link Nuzlock with a friend?
Trying to work out how on earth you'll keep track of the routes, pokemon, if they've fainted, and what the optimal team is?

You're in the right place!

This is in development and still being worked on.

There is no server, your teams are saved to browser, but you can export for safe keeping or to transfer between PCs!
